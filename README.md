# Tailwind CSS Gradient Rendering Issue

This repository demonstrates a bug where Tailwind CSS gradients fail to render correctly. This is often caused by an outdated or incorrectly configured Tailwind installation.

## Bug

The gradient in `bug.html` does not render as expected. Instead of a smooth transition between blue and purple, it displays only one color or a broken gradient.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring that Tailwind CSS is properly installed and configured.  The corrected code is in `bugSolution.html`.  This involves verifying your Tailwind configuration file (`tailwind.config.js` or `tailwind.config.cjs`) and reinstalling Tailwind if necessary.  It's recommended to follow the official Tailwind CSS installation and configuration instructions for your project setup.
